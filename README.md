# Single Thread Vs Multi Threaded in Java


### Single Threaded 
Created a socket at port 8010 for the client and server to have a TCP handshake for further communication


### Multi Threaded
Used the consumer class to accept incoming request and creating new threads with the runnable overridden in the code, as for the client side we are sending multiple requests using runnable, threads and for loop.
